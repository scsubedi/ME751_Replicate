	1. The value of the expression of the constraint
	2. The right-hand side of the  velocity equation(mu)
	3. The right-hand side of the acceleration equation (gamma),
	4. The expression for partial derivatives phi_R
	5. The expression for   partial derivatives phi_p 
2. Use groundStatus(0-1) to ground the body j
	0. Ungrounded
	1. Grounded
3. Saves file with all the results.
